NOHUP(1)                                                                            User Commands                                                                            NOHUP(1)

NAME
       nohup - run a command immune to hangups, with output to a non-tty

SYNOPSIS
       nohup COMMAND [ARG]...
       nohup OPTION

DESCRIPTION
       Run COMMAND, ignoring hangup signals.

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       If  standard  input  is a terminal, redirect it from an unreadable file.  If standard output is a terminal, append output to 'nohup.out' if possible, '$HOME/nohup.out' other‐
       wise.  If standard error is a terminal, redirect it to standard output.  To save output to FILE, use 'nohup COMMAND > FILE'.

       NOTE: your shell may have its own version of nohup, which usually supersedes the version described here.  Please refer to your shell's documentation for details about the op‐
       tions it supports.

   Exit status:
       125    if the nohup command itself fails

       126    if COMMAND is found but cannot be invoked

       127    if COMMAND cannot be found

       -      the exit status of COMMAND otherwise
